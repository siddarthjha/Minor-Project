# Minor-Project
My first project undertaking in C language

TOPIC: **Comparitive analysis of Un-informed Search Algorithms**


Implementation of 
1. DFS
2. BFS
3. DLS
4. IDDFS,
all these algorithms in C language and their comparison with respect to time and space complexity.

## State Space Search
Set of all possible states for a given problem is known as state space of the problem.

There are two types of search:
1. **Un-informed Search**
2. **Informed Search**

### Un-informed Search
These are such problems where we don't know any domain specific information. So we have to search without any additional knowledge of the target state. Hit and trial method.

### Informed Search
In this type of problems we have prior knowledge of our target state like functions to guide the search proceedures. So we will be able to get to the target state.

**Note:** Knowledge in the previous context means "**Derived from experience,Stores experience and change the search rules further**"".

For Searching, We need
1. Initial state description of problem.
2. Set of legal operators[Conditions].
3. Final (or) goal state.
